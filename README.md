# Load Balancer Solution With Nginx and SSL/TLS

This project focuses on deploying a scalable and secure web architecture by implementing Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer, combined with end-to-end HTTPS encryption using Let’s Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates. The solution demonstrates essential DevOps capabilities including traffic distribution, high availability design, certificate automation with Certbot, and secure communication enforcement.

By completing this project, engineers gain real-world experience configuring Nginx load-balancing mechanisms, establishing trusted SSL termination, managing DNS and domain validation, and ensuring compliant, encrypted data flow across all layers of a web system.
